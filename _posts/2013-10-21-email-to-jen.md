Hi Jen,

I am trying to use the Java-web-based GSEA platform.

I have created an annotation file in the *.CLS format (183 samples), a tab-delimited expression file, and a geneset file in the *.GRP format (2629 DE genes for Lungevity).

When I run the GSEA, I get an error about none of the genes passing the size thresholds. I have tried to reduce the number of genes to 500 (set max default), but that didn't help.

I am using the "Do not collapse data to gene symbols" options, and I am not providing a chip file. yet, it seems the problem is related to the Gene IDs I am using.. have you ever ran into a similar problem?

Thank Jen!

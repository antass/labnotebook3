## To-do for tomorrow

1. [ ] *Sanity check*: 
	- Ylinked genes in sex-related modules
	- smoking genes
	- cancer genes
1. [ ] Regenerate eigengene heatmaps for each set
2. [ ] Make eigengene heatmaps for each pair of sets (Lam vs. Allegro, Lam vs. Airway, etc.)
	- generate correlation matrix per module pair
3. [ ] Identify modules that highly correlate between sets
4. [ ] Identify common genes to those highly correlating modules
5. [ ] Plot heatmaps for each of the common modules for all common genes (look for interesting patterns not related to clinical traits)
